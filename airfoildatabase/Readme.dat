In this midterm project, learning Python programming language, defining airfoil structures in Python,  
better understanding on usage of Python in aerospace engineering, by using Kutta Condition defining 
airfoil which is cusped or pointed and defining these terms in python are aimed. Defining structural objects 
of airfoils and plotting in Python such as chord line , mean camber line, trailing edge, leading edge, camber 
and thicknesses are given as a task. Therefore, 
aerodynamic properties like panel normal is given too. The required data for 100 airfoil was downloaded
 from http://hm-selig.ae.illinois.edu./ads.html for shaping airfoil in Python. In this study, shaping and 
detailing processes of more than 100 airfoil is done and these foils are ready to use in any scientific project
 about airfoils. Implementations and airfoil “.txt” files are uploaded in GitHub platform as a public study 
and shared for all users. Plotting and introducing coordinate system and created object from it in the Python 
is learnt. As an aircraft engineer, database of airfoils and geometric specifications on the airfoils are 
created and this database can be useful for next projects about aircraft and airfoils.
