# AirfoilDatabase

In order to shape the airfoil in Python, the necessary data for 100 airfoils were downloaded from http://hm-selig.ae.illinois.edu./ads.html. In this study, more than
100 airfoils were shaped and detailed and these airfoils were made ready for use in any scientific project related to airfoils. The applications and airfoil ".txt" 
files were uploaded to GitHub platform as a public work and shared for all users. Structure of the trailing edge was determined using the Kutta condition.
