# AirfoilDatabase
Python programlama dili kullanarak airfoilin panel normalleri, mean camber, chord line ve maximum thickness'larını hesapladığım ve 
figürlerini çıkarttığım, 100'den fazla airfoil bulunduran database.

In this midterm project, learning Python programming language, defining airfoil structures in python,  better understanding on usage
of Python in aerospace engineering, by using Kutta Condition defining airfoil which is cusped or pointed and defining these terms in
python are aimed. Defining structural objects of airfoil and plotting in Python such as chord lines , mean camber lines, trailing edges,
leading edges, cambers and thicknesses are given as a task. Therefore, the aerodynamic properties like panel normal is given as a task
too. The required data for 100 airfoil was downloaded from http://hm-selig.ae.illinois.edu./ads.html for shaping airfoil in Python.
In this study, shaping and detailing processes of more than 100 airfoil is done and these foils are ready to use in any scientific 
project about airfoils. Implementations and airfoil “.txt” files are uploaded in GitHub platform as a public study and shared for 
all users. Plotting and introducing coordinate system and created object from it in the Python is studied. As an aircraft engineer, 
database of airfoils and geometric specifications on the airfoils are created and this database can be useful for next projects about 
aircraft and airfoils.
